ColdStorage Management System
This is a web-based application designed for managing cold storage personnel and their contact information. Built with Flask, MySQL, and Bootstrap, it provides a secure and user-friendly interface for administrators to register, view, edit, and delete user records. The system includes authentication, phone number validation, and a responsive dashboard for efficient data management.

The project features secure user authentication with hashed passwords, a dashboard to manage user details (name, phone, city, cold storage code, and cold storage phone), and search functionality to filter users by name, phone, or code. Phone numbers are validated using regular expressions to ensure they follow the Iranian format (e.g., 09123456789), supporting inputs like +989123456789 or 00989123456789. The UI leverages Bootstrap 5 for a clean, mobile-friendly experience with modals for adding/editing users and alerts for feedback. The backend uses Peewee ORM to interact with a MySQL database, with two models: User for personnel data and LoginUser for authentication.

The tech stack includes Python 3.8+, Flask, Peewee, MySQL, werkzeug.security for password hashing, and Bootstrap 5 for the frontend. The project structure is organized as follows: app.py for the main application logic, model.py for database models and phone validation, config.py for database settings, and a templates folder containing index.html (dashboard), login.html, and register.html. Static files (CSS, JS) are stored in the static folder.

To set up the project, ensure you have Python 3.8+ and a MySQL server installed. Clone the repository with git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coldstorage.git and navigate to the project directory. Optionally, create a virtual environment using python -m venv venv and activate it (source venv/bin/activate on Linux/Mac or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows). Install dependencies with pip install flask werkzeug peewee pymysql. Configure MySQL by creating a database (CREATE DATABASE coldstorage_db;) and granting privileges (GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON coldstorage_db.* TO 'your_mysql_username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_mysql_password';). Update config.py with your MySQL credentials (e.g., DB_USER = 'your_mysql_username', DB_PASS = 'your_mysql_password', DB_PORT = '3306', DB_DATABASE = 'coldstorage_db'). Run the app with python app.py, and access it at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

To use the system, start by registering at /register with an email and password. Log in at / using your credentials to access the dashboard at /main. From there, you can add new users via a modal form, view the user list in a table, search by name/phone/code, edit existing records, or delete users. Phone numbers are automatically validated to ensure correctness. Log out to end your session securely.

The database includes two tables: user (columns: id, name, telephone, city, coldrooms_code, coldrooms_phone) and loginuser (columns: id, email, password). Future improvements could include role-based access (admin vs. regular users), advanced search filters, CSV export, or pagination for large datasets.
